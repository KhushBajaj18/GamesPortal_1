download the repo as a zip, and then open it. then, go to the terminal and follow these steps:
1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm run dev`
3. click on the localhost link
but wait, you still won’t see the games — you’ll just see the ui. to see the games, you need to run a script on your terminal. don’t worry, it just disables your web security for that session. since the apis are not public, you need to do this to access the games. before hitting the localhost link, run this script on your terminal, and boom — chrome will automatically open. then, open localhost in chrome and there you go — you can play all the games for free and enjoy with no limits. also, there’s nothing fishy or hacking-related going on. you can even search the web about the script i gave you.
i know it’s a lot of work, but hey, i got the api keys and gave you free games. so just two minutes of work for a lifetime of game enjoyment. sounds like a good deal to me!

This is my Portal(Main objective of this is to enable you to play free games for life)
